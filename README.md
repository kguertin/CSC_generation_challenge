# README - CSC GENERATION

hello reviewer! Thanks for taking the time to look at my solution!

## Assumptions

Just wanted to give you some insight into my solution.

1. I identified that this would be a good candidate for a sort function but was unsure about what kind of sort pattern to use. I settled on a merge sort.
2. I first considered using insertion sort but I decided it would not scale well with a large ammount of data.

This was really fun to work on and I look foward to getting into more technical discussion with the CSC Generation team.
